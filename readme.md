## Description
### Marks secured by the students in high school students from the United States.

## Meta Data 
•	Gender : Male or Female Students
•	Race/ethnicity : Determine the ethnictity of student {group A , B , C , D, E }
•	Lunch : free/reduced or standard lunch plan
•	Parental Level Degree : The degree took by parents {some high school , high school , some college , associate ,bachelor’s ,master’s}
•	Math , Reading , Writing scores : the score the student got on the test 
•	Percentage (Engineered Feature ) : the average score in the three subjects scores 
 
## Main Findings with Explaratory Data Analysis

1.	Students who completed the test preparation course managed to score more on average than students who didn’t take the course 
2.	Students with Standard lunch plan managed to get a higher score on average than students with free/reduced lunch plans
3.	The correlation between writing score and reading score is 0.97 which indicated really strong correlation between reading and writing skills 
4.	There was no discrimination against certain race or gender as they scored very close percentages on average
5.	Parental degree is not a factor in students score as they scored very close on average 
6.	People with standard lunch and who took the course scored the highest on average while people with reduced lunch and didn't take the course scored the lowest on average 
7.	People with standard lunch and didn't take the course and people with free/reduced lunch who took the course scored nearly the same

## Main findings with Explanatory Data Analysis

1.	Students who completed the test preparation course managed to score 7.6% more on average with standard deviation of 0.9% than students who didn’t take the course with a range between 3.8 and 11.6 points with confidence interval = 100%
2.	Students who had the standard lunch plan managed to score 8.64% more on average with standard deviation of 0.92% than students who didn’t take the course with a range between 4.8 and 12.4 points with confidence interval = 100%

## Summary 

for the presentation I focused on univariate distribution and count for all 9 variables then tested the relationship between every variable and the percentage to find out the lunch plan and test preparation course status have a main effect on the test percentage that students who completed the test preparation course managed to score more on average than students who didn’t take the course  and students with Standard lunch plan managed to get a higher score on average than students with free/reduced lunch plans
for the multivariate section i just tested the relation shipbetween the lunch plan , the course status and the percentage to find out that People with standard lunch and who took the course scored the highest on average while people with reduced lunch and didn't take the course scored the lowest on average while People with standard lunch and didn't take the course and people with free/reduced lunch who took the course scored nearly the same
then I performed an hypothesis test to confirm the findings which was confirmed with pvalue 0.00
